        <p> This website is integrated with CRISPRCAN which is a manually curated database of cancer and crispr screens. The main motive behind this database is to create a platform where you can easily associate cancer and its respective CRISPR/Cas9 gene. 
            With the drastic benefits of the gene editing tool, the application of it increases. 
            This database aims to provide a detailed enclosure on related topics in one area. 
            Unlike the existing databases, CANCRISPR provides integrated cancer information with the gene involved. 
            The target site, cancer type, phenotype observed, analysis type, etc are associated to a specific gene. 
            This website is integrated with CRISPRCAN which is a manually curated database of cancer and crispr screens. 
            Its attributes include cell type, cell line,  phenotype , analysis, methodolody and cancer organ  lines . The following features are included: </p> 
        <br>
        <ul class="a" style="padding:10px;">
            <li>>>: Visual diagrams are displayed which gives a better understanding of the data present in the database. Based on the detail browsed, the user can locate a specific attribute through the search bar. The diagrams include the numerous the cancer organs present.</li>
            <br>
            <li>>>SEARCH: Data can be searched by inputing keywords like methods, cell line or any other attribute. It would result in the display of a table corresponding to the keyword. In additon, a button is provided for each screening to redirect to a secondary table for more information on that crispr screening.</li>
            <br>
            <li>>>TOOLS: Crispr associated tools are included in the card display which provide a brief description and use of the tool. At the bottom ,' go now' link is given whoch redirects to that tool website.
                  The tools are CHOPCHOP, CAS-OFFINDER, GUIDEScan, GUIDEMARKER, CRISPRdirect, and VARSCOT.   
                  CHOPCHOP (version 3) is a web tool for selecting target sites for CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cpf1, CRISPR/Cas13 or NICKASE/TALEN-directed mutagenesis.

                  CAS-OFFINDER is a fast and versatile algorithm that searches for potential off-target sites of Cas9 RNA-guided endonucleases
                  CRISPRdirect is a simple and functional web server for selecting rational CRISPR/Cas targets from an input sequence. 
                  VARSCOT is a tool that takes sequence variants of individuals for CRISPR/Cas9 off-target search and scoring into account
                  Guidemarker is a software to design CRISPR-Cas guide RNA pools in non-model genomes.
                  GuideScan software for the design of CRISPR guide RNA libraries that can be used to edit coding and noncoding genomic regions.
